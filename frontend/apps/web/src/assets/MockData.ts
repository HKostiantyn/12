      '<p>Wall Street\'s focus on Friday was on the October jobs report. Employment growth took a hit, as largely expected, due to hurricanes and a machinists\' strike at planemaker Boeing (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA" title="The Boeing Company">BA</a>).</p> <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the economy <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4233376-nonfarm-payroll-slides-more-than-expected-in-october-hit-by-strike-and-hurricanes" class="paywall-full-content invisible">added</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> 12K jobs in October, the lowest level since late 2020. The agency said it was "likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by" hurricanes Helene and Milton. BLS also noted that the Boeing (</span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA" title="The Boeing Company" class="paywall-full-content invisible">BA</a><span class="paywall-full-content invisible">) strike likely subtracted 44K jobs in the transportation equipment manufacturing industry.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Meanwhile, the job growth figures for September and August were revised downward, to +223K from +254K and to +78K from +159K, respectively. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">U.S. stocks (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500" title="S&amp;P 500 Index">SP500</a>) opened <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4233054-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market">higher</a> after the data, as the hit to job creation was widely anticipated. Market sentiment also received a bump due to a post-earnings surge in e-commerce and tech behemoth Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>). Here are some exchange-traded funds that track the benchmark index: (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY" title="SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust">SPY</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO" title="Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF">VOO</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV" title="iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF">IVV</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP" title="Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF">RSP</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSO" title="ProShares Trust - ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500">SSO</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO" title="ProShares Trust - ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P500">UPRO</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH" title="ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF">SH</a>), (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SDS" title="ProShares UltraShort S&amp;P 500 ETF">SDS</a>), and (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPXU" title="ProShares UltraPro Short S&amp;P 500 ETF">SPXU</a>). </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">See below for various reactions to the jobs report:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/david-alton-clark">David Alton Clark</a>, investing group leader of The Winter Warrior Investor</strong>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"The non-farm payrolls report came in below expectations at 12,000, the lowest level in years. Even so, the recent strikes and storms made the top-line number extremely noisy.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The more important piece of the puzzle was unemployment remained at 4.1%, even with the low payrolls number. This is due to the fact that the data comes from the household survey, which includes workers out due to the strikes and storms. What’s more, recent data from the ADP report shows hiring has been above forecast and jobless claims the lowest in months. </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">These developments coupled with the massive revisions of past reports make this jobs report a moot point for market participants. I expect the market will look through the headline number this time."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/chris-lau">Chris Lau</a>, investing group leader of DIY Value Investing</strong>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"October\'s job growth was similar to that of the previous month. As expected, the government hiring uptrend contributed (+40,000). While strike activity led to job declines in manufacturing (transportation equipment), the slowdown in automotive will continue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The BLS sharply cut its August employment count (-81,000) and September (-31,000). Still, the job situation in the last three months would justify the Fed pausing rate cuts next month."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Michael Kramer, founder of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/mott-capital-management">Mott Capital Management</a> and investing group leader of Reading The Markets</strong>: </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"The October job report was expected to be a mess, but this was just worse than expected. Most of the critical figures came in line with the unemployment rate and the wage data. However, the hurricane appears to have impacted the nonfarm payroll, and the BLS noted the establishment survey had a well below-average response rate." </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo</strong>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"We expected a noisy October employment report due to Hurricanes Helene and Milton as well as some strike activity, and the event delivered on those expectations. Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 12K in October, the weakest reading for payroll growth since December 2020.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">That said, when doing our best to look through the noise, there were some signs of softening in the labor market. The industry composition of employment growth in October hinted at some weakness beyond the one-off factors that drove the poor headline reading.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">On balance, the unusually weak employment report in October should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. The special factors at play likely will keep the FOMC from repeating its September 50 bps rate cut at its meeting next week. That said, the continued softening in employment conditions was consistent with the other labor market data released this week."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Jason Furman, former deputy director of the U.S. National Economic Council</strong>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"The Hurricanes affected not just reality (how many people working) but the BLS\'s ability to survey and measure reality. These distortions will show up again (in reverse) in the November numbers.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">To the degree there was any very, very small signal in this report it would be in the cumulative downward revision of 112K for August + September which might indicate a tiny bit of labor market softening. But that softening may be about getting to trend/natural rate not below it.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">But overall I recommend people tune in again next month when they should average October and November because there was not much/any signal in this month\'s report."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Renaissance Macro Research</strong>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"In service-providing industries, professional &amp; business services employment is down six of the last seven months, a clear cause for concern. This is white-collar type office employment; I don’t think you can lay the blame exclusively on the weather."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><strong>Ian Shepherdson, editor-in-chief of Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong>: </p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">"If I know one thing about US payrolls, it is that the final number for October will not be 12K. So, you can safely ignore anyone who cites that number as evidence of anything."</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">More on the markets</h2> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732014-spy-a-trump-win-may-not-fuel-a-market-rally" class="more-link">SPY: A Trump Win May Not Fuel A Market Rally</a></li> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732013-october-jobs-hit-by-hurricanes-boeing-strikes-steady-unemployment-rate" class="more-link">October Jobs Hit By Hurricanes, Boeing Strikes; Steady Unemployment Rate</a></li> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4732009-october-jobs-report-hurricanes-and-strike-activity-spook-payroll-growth" class="more-link">October Jobs Report: Hurricanes And Strike Activity Spook Payroll Growth</a></li> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4233054-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market" class="more-link">Wall Street kicks off November on a positive note as Amazon soars after earnings</a></li> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4231999-wall-street-suffers-october-blues-as-benchmark-sp-500-snaps-five-month-win-streak" class="more-link">Wall Street suffers October blues as benchmark S&amp;P 500 snaps five-month win streak</a></li> </ul>',

      '<p>Amazon (<span class="ticker-hover-wrapper">NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a></span>) rose in early trading on Friday after posting revenue, EPS, and operating income ahead of the consensus expectation of analysts. In general, analysts are buzzing over the Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) and the potential for the e-commerce<span class="paywall-full-content invisible"> stock to see more gains.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said the firm\'s concerns about the e-commerce giant\'s near-term ability to produce company-wide profit and manage through its investments in lower-priced essentials were overblown. He noted that retail EBIT came in 15% or about $900 million better than expected.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives highlighted that Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) has now reported operating income above the high end of its guidance range for the seventh consecutive quarter, and the company has a number of drivers for future margin expansion in place. Ives said those margin drivers include continued cost efficiencies within its fulfillment network, as well as the ongoing mix shift towards higher-margin AWS and advertising revenue.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney and his team said they continue to recommend Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) as a long because they see more room for AWS growth acceleration and Amazon Prime Video monetization is only just beginning. Mahaney also noted that AMZN is tapping into several new promising growth initiatives such as Pharmacy and Kuiper. In an interesting takeaway, Mahaney teased the idea of Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) paying dividends and firing off new buybacks. "Finally, because as profitability ramps, and AMZN’s cash pile grows beyond $100B, the inevitability of material capital returns rises," he wrote.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">On Seeking Alpha, analyst <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/abdullah-al-rezwan-cfa">Abdullah Al-Rezwan</a> highlighted that Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) has posted another impressive quarter. He pointed out that every part of the AMZN business seems to be trending well, and moving in the right direction.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Shares of Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN" title="Amazon.com, Inc.">AMZN</a>) were up <span class="green">6.9%</span> in premarket trading on Friday.</p> <div id="more-links" class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <h2>More on Amazon</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731932-amazon-q3-2024-earnings-update" class="more-link">Amazon Q3 2024 Earnings Update</a></li> <li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4731865-amazon-com-inc-amzn-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript" class="more-link">Amazon.com, Inc.

However, the labor force participation rate slipped to 62.6% vs. 62.7% consensus and 62.7% prior.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Average hourly earnings increased +0.4% M/M, slightly higher than +0.3% consensus, running at the same pace as in September.

"The landscape of corporate America is quickly shifting to sanity and neutrality."</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Boeing\'s (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA" title="The Boeing Company">BA</a>) DEI move also comes as it\'s streamlining operations and trimming its workforce. The efforts are aimed at cutting costs amid financial pressures and production woes brought on by a labor strike that dragged on for over a month.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The troubled planemaker made a third attempt to appease striking workers, by offering a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4232165-boeing-reaches-deal-to-end-machinist-strike">38% wage hike</a> over four years in its latest proposal.
